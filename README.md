This is a collection of Linux driver examples. These drivers cover
topics I deal with during my daily work in the Linux kernel.

The goal is to show how to deal with different subsystems using modern
techniques and framework introduced in the late 4.x and 5.x kernel
series.

Every single driver should be usable provided you have a matching
hardware. I will describe the hardware needed for every single driver
I add here.
